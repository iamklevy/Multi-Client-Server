# Multi-Client-Server

You will need a third-party tool to test this server, I recommend  downloading Putty from here: www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html. You will connect through your local IP address, and the input port will be 54000 (you can change it in the source code). connection type: SSH  -> raw. Then you are ready to open your remote client session. You can download the executable file here: Multi-Client-Server/Debug/MultipleClientServer.exe
